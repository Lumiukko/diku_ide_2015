                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>The diagram shows each country as a circle, where the size of the circle corresponds to the size of its population, the position on the x-axis corresponds to the life expectancy, and the position on the y-axis corresponds to the fertility rate. The data corresponding to the axes can be freely chosen among all data that is available in the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>. The time progression over the years is additionally shown as an animation. Additionally, the circles are color coded by continent.
                    <p>In this particular example most of the countries have moved towards the bottom right corner of the diagram over time, which signifies that the fertility rate dropped and the life expectancy raised.</p>
                    <p>The visualization tool <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder.org</a> shows the same visualization developed by Hans Rosling and his team. In an older version of this tool it was further possible to separate the circles on click into their respective regions or provinces.</p>

                    <h4>Positive and Negative Aspects</h4>

                        <li>Positive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lots of features in one visualization: data for both axes, population size as bubble size, continent by color code, and time progression by interactive slider or animation.</li>
                            <li>On mouse-over, information for each country is shown.</li>

                    <a class="vis_page" href="http://insightfulinteraction.com/armsexport.html">insightfulinteraction.com</a>
                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This chord diagram shows the origin and destination countries of weapon exports in 2013. It was developed by <a href="http://insightfulinteraction.com/about.html">Natalia Bronshtein</a> using d3.js and is based on data from the <a href="http://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers">SIPRI Arms Transfers Database</a>. The work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p>
                    <p>The diagram lists countries (or fighting factions) alphabetically on the outside of a circle and shows connections between weapon exporter and importer, where the volume of the export in $USD is indicated by the thickness of the connection at its base at the exporting country.</p>

                    <h4>Positive and Negative Aspects</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Positive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diagram type suited to show volume of many-to-many relationships</li>
                            <li>More detailed information is available on mouseover</li>
                            <li>Countries are listed alphabetically and therefore easier to find</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Negative</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Countries are listed alphabetically, no visual indication of export volume by order</li>
                            <li>Lacks of drill down functionality especially for small weapon exporters</li>
                            <li>The visualizaton does not show the share of a country of the total weapon imports of a customer country. There is another <a href="http://insightfulinteraction.com/armsimport.html">visualization</a> which shows the imports</li>
                        </ul>

                    <a class="vis_page" href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v527/n7577_supp/interactive/nature-collab.html">nature.com</a>
                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This network diagram shows the collaboration between research institutions. Institutions who published papers in journals that are tracked by the <a href="http://www.natureindex.com/">Nature Index</a> are the nodes. The volume of a node is determined by the research output and the clustering is based on the research output and the connections to other institutions. The thicker the connection to another institution is the more papers were published together. The color marks either the geographical region or the type of the institution (industry or university research).</p>
                    <p>The user has the posibility to select and display subsets by geography and change the coloring to either indicate the type of the instituion or the region.</p>
                    <p>The visualization was developed by Ian Calvert, Tamar Loach and Martin Szomszor of <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> JavaScript library.</p>
                    <h4>Positive and Negative Aspects</h4>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Clustering and color makes general pattern recognition easy</li>
                            <li>More detailed information is available on mouseclick</li>
                            <li>Subset selection allows to drill down up to a certain level</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Negative</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hard to find individual institutes</li>
                            <li>Selection of multiple-subsets (North-American and European institutions or industry research institutions in Pacific Asia) is not possible</li>
                            <li>Clicking on each node is tedious (in comparison to mouseover with a small time interval)</li>

                    <h3>3.3 Marco</h3>
                    <h4>3.3.1 Premise</h4>
                    <p>I do not have a definite data set at this moment. Therefore, the current idea is only tentative. It is quite difficult to think about a visualization without knowing the exact features of the data I will get.</p>
                    </p>I am using the following scenario as a premise: I would like to get a dataset of measurements done by healthcare professionals or individuals with access to equipment in order to make their own measurements (e.g. blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, oxygenation, heart rate, etc.). Additionally, there should be some labels available, which show the current health status of the corresponding (e.g. healthy, experiencing symptom X or ill with a specific disease Y).</p>
                    <h4>3.3.2 What should the accompanying text say about the visualization?</h4>
                    <p>The accompanying text should explain how to interpret the visualization and explain the controls, i.e. the interactive elements of the visualization. The interactivity could be switching between different types of measurements. At a later stage, the visualization could “follow” the development of the measurements for one specific individual.</p>
                    <h4>3.3.3 What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</h4>
                    <p>The combination of text and visualization would tell how to see correlations between the measurements and the health status of the user, and in the future the trend or development for a specific user over time. It would be used to find correlations or to simply show the current estimation (or prediction) of the user’s health.</p>
                    <h4>3.3.4 Who is the intended audience?</h4>
                    <p>The intended audience are health professionals and users who are interested in an indicator for their health based on their measurements.</p>
                    <h4>3.3.5 Where would you get the dataset from?</h4>
                    <p>Healthcare facilities/departments or lifelogging communities. However, healthcare facilities have often rigorous non-disclosure requirements and rules for anonymization of data, which might cause a time issue. Lifelogging enthusiasts are often more willing to offer their data with the prospect of gaining some insight. Furthermore, their data often includes relevant data, as they collect a vast number of information. Unfortunately, their data may be quite sparse or “dirty”, i.e. the measurements may be very infrequent and have missing or wrong information.</p>
                    <h4>3.3.6 A sketch or mockup of the visualization.</h4>
