                    <a class="vis_page" href="http://www.gapminder.org/">Gapminder.org</a>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>Gapminder was developed by Prof. Hans Rosling and his teamt to display the development of health and wealth across the past few decades for a multitude of countries. The diagram shows each country as a circle, where the size of the circle corresponds to the size of its population, the position on the x-axis corresponds to the wealth, and the position on the y-axis corresponds to health. The time progression over the years is additionally shown as an animation. Additionally, the circles are color coded by continent.</p>
                    <p>The original visualization contained interactive elements. For example, each country could be seperated into its regions by clicking on the corresponding circle. Furthermore, the time animation can be controlled with a slider widget.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Positive and Negative Aspects</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Positive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lots of features in one visualization: wealth, health, population size, continent, and time progression.</li>
                            <li>Original version included a way to break down the circles into a countries regions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Negative</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interactivity or animation required to see the time progression.</li>
                            <li>Very slow. The online version uses Flash.</li>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This chord diagram shows the origin and destination countries of weapon exports in 2013. It was developed by <a href="http://insightfulinteraction.com/about.html">Natalia Bronshtein</a> using d3.js and is based on data from the <a href="http://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers">SIPRI Arms Transfers Database</a>. The work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.</p>
                    <p>The diagram lists countries (or fighting factions) alphabetically on the outside of a circle and shows connections between weapon exporter and importer, where the volume of the export in $USD is indicated by the thickness of the connection at its base at the exporting country.</p>

                    <h4>Positive and Negative Aspects</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Positive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Diagram type suited to show volume of many-to-many relationships</li>
                            <li>More detailed information is available on mouseover</li>
                            <li>Countries are listed alphabetically and therefore easier to find</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Negative</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Countries are listed alphabetically, no visual indication of export volume by order</li>
                            <li>Lacks of drill down functionality especially for small weapon exporters</li>
                            <li>The visualizaton does not show the share of a country of the total weapon imports of a customer country. There is another <a href="http://insightfulinteraction.com/armsimport.html">visualization</a> which shows the imports</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This diagram shows the correlation between the number of children per women and the life expectancy. The bubles are colored by region and the size of each buble corresponds to the size of country's population.</p>
					<p>The graph is based on data from <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a>.</p>
                    <p>Over the time, most of the countries have moved towards the bottom right corner of the diagram, which signifies that the fertility rate dropped and the life expectancy raised.</p>

                    <h4>Description</h4>
                    <p>This network diagram shows the collaboration between research institutions. Institutions who published papers in journals that are tracked by the <a href="http://www.natureindex.com/">Nature Index</a> as nodes. The volume of the node is determined by the research output and the clustering is based on the research output and the connections to other institutions. The thicker the connection to another institution is the more papers were published together.</p>
                    <p>The user has the posibility to select subsets by geography or by the type of instituion (industry or university research).</p>
                    <p>The visualization was developed by Ian Calvert, Tamar Loach and Martin Szomszor of <a href="https://www.digital-science.com/">Digital Science</a> using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">leaflet</a> JavaScript library.</p>
