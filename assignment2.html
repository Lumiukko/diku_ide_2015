					<p>TODO: Add more, this is just one of the paragraphs.</p>
					<p>Our main motivation is to find out how the temperatures have changed during the last century and therefore we would like to get some meaningful answers to the following questions:
						<ul>
							<li>Which year was the hottest one? What about the coldest one?</li>
							<li>Have there been any extreme changes from one year to another? </li>
							<li>Is there a steady rise in temperatures? So should we be concerned about global warming?</li>
							<li>Are there any noticeable trends or patterns in the average temperature variations?</li>
						</ul>

                    <p>TODO: Add more, this is just one of the paragraphs.</p>
                    <p>Since the original data is saved in a file where the values are separated by an arbitrary amount of spaces, we had the choice to either convert the data first into an easier readable format, or to write an own conversion method in JavaScript. We decided for the latter for the simple reason, that we do not have to pre-process the data before using it. This enables us to link directly into the source file and offers the possibility to let the user use any weather data with our visualization he desires.</p>

					<p>One good idea could be to compare the average temperatures, during the last century, with the level of precipitations, the average temperature of sea / oceans and also the level of CO2 emissions. Therefore, there is the possibility of finding out if there is any correlation between those elements and on top of that if there is any pattern followed by all four measured elements.</p>
